# Medical Image Processing with Different Filters

## Overview

This project focuses on medical image processing using various image processing filters. The application of these filters aims to enhance medical images for better analysis and diagnosis.

## Features

- **Image Enhancement:** Apply different filters to enhance contrast, reduce noise, and improve overall image quality.

- **Filter Types:**
  - [ ] Gaussian Filter
  - [ ] Median Filter
  - [ ] Sobel Filter (Vertical, Horizontal)
  - [ ] Laplacian Filter
  - [ ] Custom Filters
  - [ ] Canny Edge Detection
  - [ ] Euclidean Transformation
  - [ ] Projective Trabsformation
  - [ ] Linear Interpolation
  - [ ] Cubic Interpolation
  - [ ] Skewed Size Interpolation
  - [ ] Vertical Wave
  - [ ] Identify Filter
  - [ ] Motion Blurr
  - [ ] Image Sharpening
  - [ ] Execessive Image Sharpening
  - [ ] Edge Enhancement
  - [ ] Embossing (south-west, north-west, ...)
  - [ ] Erosion
  - [ ] Dilusion
  - [ ] Gaussian Kernel
  - [ ] Histogram Equalizer (with RGB)
  - [ ] Median Filter
  - [ ] Bilateral Filter

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - [ ] Loading medical images for processing.
   - [ ] Preprocessing steps if required (resizing, normalization, etc.).

2. **Filter Implementation:**
   - [ ] Implementation of various image processing filters.
   - [ ] Custom filter design and application (if applicable).

3. **Visualization:**
   - [ ] Displaying original and processed images for comparison.

4. **Documentation:**
   - [ ] README file describing the project, its components, and usage instructions.
   - [ ] Additional documentation for code comments and project structure.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- Required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, OpenCV, etc.)
  
## Usage:
Provide instructions on how to use the project. Include any configuration settings, input formats, or other relevant details.
